I wrote some functions with elisp to help me analyze core dumps & call stacks. I think they are very
helpful, so I've decided to rewrite them in Rust, making them usable outside of Emacs.

Tool to show call stack of process(es)

Usage: cs [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...

Arguments:
  [ARGS]...  Purpose of these args may change based other options:
             1. When listing/choosing processes, this is default initial value or pattern to filter process.
             2. When uniquifying stacks, this could be files to read stack from ("-" for stdin); multiple
                files will be merged together.

Options:
  -p, --pid <PIDS>               Show stack of process PID
  -c, --core <CORE>              Show stack found in COREFILE
  -e, --executable <EXECUTABLE>  (optional) EXECUTABLE that produced COREFILE
  -u, --users <USERS>            Show processes of users (separated by \",\") when listing/choosing processes
  -l, --list                     List processes
  -W, --Wide                     Wide mode: when showing processes, show all chars in a line
  -M, --multi                    Multi mode: when choosing processes, to select multiple processes
  -U, --unique                   Unique mode: when showing call stack, show only unique ones
  -G, --gdb                      gdb mode: use gdb to get call stack (default to eu-stack)
  -R, --raw                      Raw mode: do not try to simplify callstacks (works only in GDB mode)
  -N, --no-pager                 Disable pager
  -P, --pattern <PATTERN>        Show call stacks of processes whose name matches PATTERN
  -h, --help                     Print help
  -V, --version                  Print version
